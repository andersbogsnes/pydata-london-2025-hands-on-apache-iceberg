    "# Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Iceberg (and other lakehouses) don't provide indexes that you may be used to from a more traditional datawarehouse, but they do provide a concept of partitioning, which serves a similar purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning refers to structuring the way the files are saved to disk in order to co-locate ranges of values. This makes it more likely that the query engine only has to read a few files to get all the requested data instead of all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't noticed the theme yet, it's all about eliminating as much disk I/O as possible. The less files we have to scan, the more performant our query is!\n",
    "\n",
    "Iceberg implements what they call *Hidden Partitioning*, and let's digress a little bit to the past to understand what that means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hive implemented *Explicit partitioning*, where the user needs to be aware of the partitioning and explicitly use when reading and writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} images/hive_partitioning.png\n",
    ":alt: Hive-style partitioning\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    ":figwidth: image\n",
    "\n",
    "Hive-style partitioning\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue with Hive-style partitioning is that it is explicit.\n",
    "Given this partitioning scheme, if I wanted to query a range 2024-01-01 <=> 2024-02-28 I might want to write this query\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE review_date between '2024-01-01' AND '2024-02-28'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query would not use the index, as Hive is explicitly expecting a year, month and date filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * from reviews where year = 2024 AND (month = 1 OR month = 2) AND DAY BETWEEN 1 and 31\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Iceberg hides this complexity away from the user, hence **Hidden Partitioning**\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have defined our partitioning when we created the table, but like much of data engineering, we often realize later that we needed it. Predicting query patterns up-front is a big ask. "

For keys and identifiers, Bucket and Truncate are used to ensure a distributed write pattern. \n",
