# Hands on with Apache Iceberg
> What is Apache Iceberg and why should you care? 

Welcome to this hands-on demo of Apache Iceberg in Python. We will go through what 
Apache Iceberg is, how it works and why you should care, and of course 
we will play with some real-life data.

## Prerequisites
You will need Docker and Docker Compose installed, as we will be running a number of containers
for the various backing services we need. Once the data and images are downloaded, there is no 
further internet access required - the material itself is 100% offline.

### Linux
See https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

### Windows
See https://docs.docker.com/desktop/

### MacOS
I recommend Orbstack:
See https://orbstack.dev/

With Docker and Docker Compose installed, run the following which will start the required
services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Installing the CLI
You'll need to download some data as well as bootstrap our catalog. For your convenience,
this project includes a CLI to do so. 

#### With UV (Recommended)
Install UV with your preferred method as outlined 
[here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) - you can now use `uv` to run the
CLI, and it will automatically create a `.venv` and install the required dependencies

```bash
uv run iceberg --help
```

#### With pip
Create and activate a virtualenv using your preferred method

Once the venv is activated, install the CLI using the following:

```bash
python -m pip install .
```

You should now be able to run 

```bash
iceberg --help
```

## Bootstrapping services
We need to bootstrap our catalog and object storage

```bash 
iceberg bootstrap
``` 

## Getting the data
We are using Gov.uk's `Price Paid Data` which registers every property sale in 
England and Wales. They publish monthly data starting in 1995.

> Contains HM Land Registry data Â© Crown copyright and database right 2021. 
> This data is licensed under the 
> [Open Government Licence v3.0](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

### Data dictionary
Gov.uk also provides a data dictionary for this data that is a handy reference when looking at
the data
https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-the-price-paid-data

### Download the data

```bash
iceberg download housing
```
While gov.uk has data back from 1995, by default, the CLI will download data starting in 2015, 
mainly to not have to wait around 10 minutes when processing the data. If you want to explore 
further back, set the `--start-year` option to the year you're interested in.


## Included Data
In the data folder, there are some pre-downloaded datasets. 

### `./data/fx/USD_GBP.csv`
This data is sourced from the Wall Street Journal's historical prices page:
https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/fx/USDGBP/historical-prices

### Gold Prices
Gold prices were sourced from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/novandraanugrah/xauusd-gold-price-historical-data-2004-2024/data

### Stock prices
Stock ticker historical prices are sourced from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` package
